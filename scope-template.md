## Product Name: 

BLK Social Journalist's How-Tos (blksocialjournalist.com/how-tos)

## Goals:
A resource Squarespace, Google or a WordPress.org site of how tos of covering Black Lives Matter narratives that are typically overlooked or poorly covered.

Slack: invite-only discussions w/ key members of Black Lives Matter community about narratives that arenâ€™t be covered in the news and talked about by society on a greater scale.

Slack: Community and I will collaborate and come up with ideas towards how mainstream media should cover each of these narratives.
Each of these conversations about individual narratives will be converted into how-tos for the main website. 

## Key Users:
Slack Users: Myself, core members of Black Lives Matter.

Main site: For Black Lives Matter community, engagement journalists/community managers, and general pubic.

## Desgin Features: 
Slack: Invite-Only, private conversations.

No trolling. Community and I only coversing about narratives overlooked or poorly covered in news media.

UPDATED: Jue is looking into Slack's API for converting/formmatting/downloading channels from Slack into content.

However, although this is something to look into. I'm leaning more to manually converting these Slack conversations into how-to content -- therefore I can moderate and take parts that shouldn't be in the how-tos. 

Website: 
Homepage of how-tos
-- Note: How-to dropdown navigation once the website has enough how-tos to create navigation with a drop-down of sub-categories.

Navigation Bar: 

-- About Page.

-- Resources (of other products, tools and websites focused on Black Lives Matter).

-- Ethics page of covering Black Lives Matter (Code of Ethics).

-- Contact Page.

## Tabled Ideas: 
I started an invite-only, private Slack. I'm starting the outreach to the Black Lives Matter's national core organizing, leadership and advocating community. 

Therefore, I can start digging deeper into listening, engaging and collaborating on narrative ideas that aren't being covered or coverd too poorly by mainstream media outlets. 

I surveyed the community. Therefore, each channel will be a narrative conversation -- based on some the surveys, previus conversations I had with inviduals in the community. 

Once a narrative conversation is complete, the channel of it will be archived and formatted/written into a how-to for the main website by myself. 

The site is resource of how to cover the Black Lives Matter community by the community and myself -- a collaboration.
