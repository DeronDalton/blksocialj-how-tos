## Product Name: 

BLK Social Journalist's How-Tos (blksocialjournalist.com/how-tos)

## Goals:
A resource Squarespace, Google or a WordPress.org site of how tos of covering Black Lives Matter narratives that are typically overlooked.

Slack: invite-only discussions w/ key members of Black Lives Matter community about narratives that aren’t be covered in the news and talked about by society on a greater scale.

Slack: Community and I will collaborate and come up with ideas towards how mainstream media should cover each of these narratives.
Each of these conversations about individual narratives will be converted into how-tos for main website. 

## Key Users:
Slack Users: Myself, core members of Black Lives Matter.

Main site: For Black Lives Matter community, engagement journalists/community managers, and general pubic.

## Desgin Features: 
Slack: Invite-Only, private conversations.

No trolling. Community and I only coversing about narratives overlooked or poorly covered in news media.

I know WordPress.org allows users to subscribe, login and take on different roles as editors, collaborators, etc.
But I want to explore the privacy and other functions of Google, SqaureSpace.

## Tabled Ideas: 
This semester I wills start an invite-only, private Slack of Black Lives Matter's core organizing and advocating community to listen, engage and collaborate on narrative ideas that aren't being covered or coverd too poorly by mainstream media outlets. Each narrative idea will be a channel. Once a narrative conversation is complete, the channel of it will be archived and formatted/written into a how-to for the main website by myself. The site is resource of how to cover the Black Lives Matter community by the community and myself -- a collaboration.
