Rekia Boyd, 22, was hit in the back of her head when Dante Servin, an off-duty detective shot into a crowd five times on March 22, 2012, in Chicago. She died two days later.

Servin claimed Boyd’s friend Antonio Cross pulled out an object from his pocket and pointed it at him. Servin thought it was gun, claiming he feared for his life. The object was a cell phone. Servin was charged with involuntarily manslaughter, but was found not guilty last month.

There’s been outrage, but only about 100 people attended a rally for Boyd in New York City’s Union Square on April 22, according to For Harriet.

According to social justice organizers, black women as both leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement and victims of police violence don’t get enough support and receive little of the black men-centric media coverage.

Janisha Gabriel, 34, website designer of blacklivesmatter.com, helped organize the rally for Boyd with Black Lives Matter: NYC. She expected a small turnout. She said larger white-run liberal organizations respond mainly to the deaths of black men, due to social media campaigns and news coverage in recent years.

Gabriel’s goal is to grow public resistance around black women’s deaths. She said she plans to launch a database in July, speakmyname.org, a collection of black (non-trans and trans) women and girls who were victims of state, domestic and police violence. Thus far, she has about 700 names.

"I was happy to see the black men that were there,” Gabriel said. “But ultimately we need for a lot of black men to be present in these moments."

“When domestic violence is one of our leading causes of deaths and black trans women have a life expectancy of 35 years of age,” she added. “We need black men to be very present with us to have some deep conversations.”

According to Gabriel, there’s an issue with media response. She said black women and girls, as victims of violence don’t make national media.

“Media has responded to black deaths specifically because of the social media campaigns around Trayvon Martin,” said Gabriel, who called the deaths of black men a popular topic and said people are interested in seeing black men as threatening.

“Black men’s deaths [are] associated with the concept of black men being inherently violent, which is why people are always justifying the deaths of black men. The media plays into that,” said Gabriel, who said she wants to change narratives to include all black people.

Deron Dalton, BLK Social Journalist, talked with Gabriel on a few occasions as he has built a relationship with her as a reliable source; and he is a reliable journalist who listens and reports on the community in which she is part of.

He talks with her about having larger online conversations addressing the community’s challenges. This includes society and media not talking enough about how narratives around the Black Lives Matter Movement involve intersecting social injustices that impact all black people.

He invites her into the moderated, invite-only forum in which conversations can be had on a greater scale, involving intersectional All Black Lives Matter narratives that the community feels should be discussed more by society and covered better by journalists.

By listening and engaging in these discussions, selected community engagement managers and potential social journalists will hopefully be able to bridge together these gaps in coverage. Plus, Gabriel realizes she and community members will be able to engage in a think tank for ideas and take action with possible collaborative community organizing.

As she joins the platform, she goes to the home page and the navigation bar reads: home, about, forums, members, code of conduct, resources, contact and search across.

She clicks on forums; there she sees different forums she can immerse in. She clicks on one, engages in the thread, but it sparks an idea to start another conversation. Off to her right-hand is a sidebar with the option to embed media, link to an article/post or to create an original conversation. She chooses to embed a tweet she feels needs to be discussed as a narrative on a greater scale
