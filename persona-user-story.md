# Persona and User Story (Janisha Gabriel)

Rekia Boyd, 22, was hit in the back of her head when Dante Servin, an off-duty detective shot into a crowd five times on March 22, 2012, in Chicago. She died two days later.

Servin claimed Boyd’s friend Antonio Cross pulled out an object from his pocket and pointed it at him. Servin thought it was gun, claiming he feared for his life. The object was a cell phone. Servin was charged with involuntarily manslaughter, but was found not guilty last month.

There’s been outrage, but only about 100 people attended a rally for Boyd in New York City’s Union Square on April 22, according to For Harriet.

According to social justice organizers, black women as both leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement and victims of police violence don’t get enough support and receive little of the black men-centric media coverage.

Janisha Gabriel, 34, website designer of blacklivesmatter.com, helped organize the rally for Boyd with Black Lives Matter: NYC. She expected a small turnout. She said larger white-run liberal organizations respond mainly to the deaths of black men, due to social media campaigns and news coverage in recent years.

Gabriel’s goal is to grow public resistance around black women’s deaths. She said she plans to launch a database in July, speakmyname.org, a collection of black (non-trans and trans) women and girls who were victims of state, domestic and police violence. Thus far, she has about 700 names.

"I was happy to see the black men that were there,” Gabriel said. “But ultimately we need for a lot of black men to be present in these moments."

“When domestic violence is one of our leading causes of deaths and black trans women have a life expectancy of 35 years of age,” she added. “We need black men to be very present with us to have some deep conversations.”

According to Gabriel, there’s an issue with media response. She said black women and girls, as victims of violence don’t make national media.

“Media has responded to black deaths specifically because of the social media campaigns around Trayvon Martin,” said Gabriel, who called the deaths of black men a popular topic and said people are interested in seeing black men as threatening.

“Black men’s deaths [are] associated with the concept of black men being inherently violent, which is why people are always justifying the deaths of black men. The media plays into that,” said Gabriel, who said she wants to change narratives to include all black people.

Deron Dalton, BLK Social Journalist, talked with Gabriel on a few occasions as he has built a relationship with her as a reliable source; and he is a reliable journalist who listens and reports on the community in which she is part of.

He talks with her about having larger online conversations addressing the community’s challenges. This includes society and media not talking enough about how narratives around the Black Lives Matter Movement involve intersecting social injustices that impact all black people.

He invites her into the moderated, invite-only chatroom -- called Slack -- in which conversations can be had on a greater scale, involving overlooked or previous poorly done Black Lives Matter narratives that the community feels should be discussed more by society and covered better by journalists, and news organizations. Therefore, the conversations she and other key Black Lives Matter community leaders have will be put into individual channels that will be manually converted into resource website of how-tos for covering her community. 

By listening and engaging in these discussions, Gabriel realizes she and Black Lives Matter community leaders will be able to engage in a behind-the-scenes think tank for ideas and take action with possible collaborative community organizing as well as colloaborate with me on how mainstream media outlets can listen, engage and report on this community's narratives that aren't typically covered. 

After joiing the chatroom, she goes to the main site in which the how-tos are produced and on the home page, the navigation bar reads: home w/ the how-tos, about, members, code of conduct, resources, contact and search across.

She clicks on a how-to on the homepage; she reads the content she and her key community members are responsible for conversing on for the purposes of larger consumption.
